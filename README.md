# First SDL & C Project

I'm trying to go about learning graphics programming on lower level programming languages to eventually build my own games. This is my first project towards achieving that goal. I followed the SDL wiki and their CMake project guide here: [text](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/docs/INTRO-cmake.md) to install. I though a good beginner project might be mapping out the Mandelbrot set. I can't ever remember how the math is done, so I relied a bit on ChatGPT to get my algorithm to work, but I figure that's what it's there for.

To build this project all you need is a C compiler, CMake, and to install the SDL library using this command in the project's root:
`git clone https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL.git vendored/SDL`
